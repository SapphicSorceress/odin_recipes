## About &hearts;

**Odin Recipes** is a small website showcasing a few of my family's recipes. The webiste is in French so my parents can take a look! 
It’s designed to practice building a multi-page HTML site from scratch using links, images, lists, and good structure.  

You’ll find a few delicious examples like:
- Muffins 
- Chocolate pie 
- Bechamel sauce 

Each recipe page includes ingredients, step-by-step instructions, and a touch of personality!
